# WackyWebM - module error

The WackyWebM script has gone through many changes since the video was uploaded, so it's possible that you might see an error like this:
```

node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:xxx
  throw err;
  ^

Error: Cannot find module 'upng-js'
```
To fix this, simply type `npm run` into the command prompt (this also opens a custom interface for easier use).

If this doesn't work, you can install the missing modules manually using `npm i`.
