If you cannot find the `.spicetify` folder in your **Users** folder, it's most likely been moved to your `appdata/Roaming` folder.
**To get to the `appdata\Roaming` folder, follow the steps below:**

<Steps>
    ### Open Run dialogue

    Press  `⊞ Win + R`.

    ### Enter folder
    
     Paste in `%appdata%/.spicetify` and press `Enter ↩`.

</Steps>
Your `.spicetify` folder should be in the folder that was opened.
