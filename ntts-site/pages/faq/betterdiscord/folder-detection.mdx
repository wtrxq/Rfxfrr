There are two main reasons for this, and they are as follows:

<Steps>
    ### You have Discord installed in ProgramData, rather than the local AppData.

    Change the path of your installer from what it is to `%programdata%/%username%/Discord/app-1.0.9005/resources`

    ### You have an old version of Discord in your Discord installation folder, and the installer is picking it up.

    Click `Browse` and choose the folder named `app-1.0.9005`.
</Steps>
