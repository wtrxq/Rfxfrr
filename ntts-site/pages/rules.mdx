{<h1 className="text-center text-4xl tracking-tighter font-extrabold md:text-5xl mt-8">Rules</h1>}

## 1. Follow Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    This is a catch-all rule. We base our rules on these guidelines. Breaking these rules will lead to a permanent ban.
</Callout>

#### 1.1. You must be at least 13 years old to be on Discord
Discord requires you to be at least 13 to use the platform, if you say you are younger, you will be banned. This includes joking about your age.

#### 1.2. Don’t use self-bots, nitro snipers, auto changing statuses, API exploits, or do anything that harms Discord’s servers
Discussing these topics is a bit touchy. If you say you did these things before or you are currently doing them, then you will be punished.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Sending IP loggers will fall under a ban as well.
</Callout>

#### 1.3. Don’t execute or joke about organizing raids or doxxes
If you are suggesting that people raid or doxx someone, you will be punished.
**If you share someone’s doxx, you are also doxxing them and will get banned.**

_Note: You can talk about how a server got raided or someone got mass harassed. We just ask you to not encourage the behavior._

#### 1.4. Don’t use Discord to scam or send malware / viruses
If you are found to be doing this **inside and even outside the server**, you will be permanently banned.

#### 1.5 Do not leak private information
We do not allow any personal information to be sent into the server. This will include: IPs, Addresses, Phone numbers, Legal names, as well any other identifiable information.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Giving out fake information will also lead to a ban.
</Callout>

#### 1.6 Recording VCs is not tolerated
We will not accept any cases that you make against someone due to a VC recording. Discord abides by California state law, and so do you under their TOS.
We ask that before you attempt to record any VC, you ask permission from each individual person. Should you not abide by that, you will be banned.

## 2. No NSFW Content / Gore / Being Horny

#### 2.1. Don’t talk about NSFW content
Talking about sex (or any other sexual activity), genitals, kinks, fanfiction, 
or any other content meant to inflict arousal will lead to moderation.

#### 2.2. No NSFL or gore content

Videos or content that is NSFL (not safe for life, or things that nobody wants to see), or discussion about these topics, is strictly prohibited.

#### 2.3. Don’t e-date or try to flirt with someone
Do not flirt with people, this is not a fucking dating server.
We also have minors on our server and it’s a recipe for disaster.

### 2.4. Don’t send any bait or cropped or suggestive NSFW content
Photos that look like nudity / pornography / gore but are instead like a normal tree or an optical illusion are not allowed.

Cropping out, blurring with pixels, or censoring NSFW content will result in punishment.

Sending suggestive poses of people having intercourse or any other NSFW content will result in punishment.

#### 2.5. Don’t send any form of pornography or nudity, or gore
Any photos, videos, ascii art, emotes, gifs of nudity or pornography or gore will result in a permanent ban.

#### 2.6. Don’t sexualize minors or joke about it
I do not care if you are 14 and you are calling a 14 year old actress hot.
I do not care that you are sending a joke about owning a large amount of CP.
We have a zero tolerance policy for sexualizing minors.

**_This includes flirting with minors. So, if you break rule 2.3 and flirt with someone and they turn out to be a minor, you are going to be banned._**

## 3. Be Respectful to All Members

#### 3.1. Don’t troll, be toxic, cause arguments, or be rude to members

It’s impossible to list every single way someone could break this rule but if we catch you trying to be an edgelord, you will be punished.

**_If you want to talk about sensitive topics with someone, please take it to DMs._**

#### 3.2 Don’t be racist, sexist, send death threats, or engage in hate speech

While we know people can joke about death threats, unfortunately in the age of the internet and the scale of the server, we do not care about the context of your message.
**Even if you are trying to pass it off as a joke, we do not allow any racist, sexist, hate speech, or death threats whatsoever on the server.**

**_Don’t know why we need to say this, but yes, having a swastika on your profile is hate speech. And yes, roleplaying as Hitler is not allowed._**

## 4. Don’t Spam / Be Annoying

#### 4.1. Don’t Spam in VC or Chat
Spamming reactions, messages, emotes, walls of text, zalgo text, newlines, and pings in chat is prohibited. Spamming new posts in form channels, or spamming tickets is prohibited as well.

**_Do not use spoilers to pretend to bypass automod. Do not pretend to bypass automod either, that’s called spoiler baiting._**

Using a soundboard, screeching / yelling, quickly joining and leaving a voice call is prohibited.

#### 4.2. Don’t Be Annoying
If someone is asking you to stop, or you are getting on people’s nerves, please respect their boundaries and step back.

If you are asking everyone to shut-up, you are the annoying one. Read the room.

## 5. English Only on this Server

Since our moderation systems and team rely mainly on English, we ask all users to use English.
**If you cannot speak English, please use Google Translate or perhaps find a server that will accompany you better.**

## 6. No malicious content

#### 6.1. No fake virus videos
Videos that trip someone’s antivirus are annoying. Please don’t send them.

#### 6.2. No Grabify / IP grabbing links or sending someone’s IP
Any link that is sent intentionally to record IP addresses will result in punishment.
This also includes hosting your own website and asking “who’s xxx.xxx.xxx?” while sending someone’s IP.

## 7. Discord Profiles

#### 7.1. Your Discord Profile must adhere to our rules
So any NSFW, racist, hate speech, sexist, or malicious content on your profile will result in you being punished. This includes your: name, bio, and your pronouns. 

#### 7.2. No Impersonation
Impersonation of any staff members or No Text To Speech for malicious reasons or as a joke will result in you being punished.

## 8. No Advertising

These rules apply for anyone sending a discord invite, link to their social media, or referral links to a platform.

#### 8.1. Don’t DM advertise
 DM advertising is against the ToS so we permanently ban you if you do it.
 DM advertising includes talking to people for a bit and then asking them to join your server 5 minutes later.

#### 8.2. Don’t Advertise on the server
Sending an invite link, telling people to join your server, intentionally pointing to your status or about me that contains an advertisement is strictly prohibited.
We do not allow advertising on this server.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    If someone asks for your server / social media, please DM it to them.
</Callout>

**_You cannot change your name to hoist it on the memberlist to try to advertise._**

## 9. Don’t Bypass Automod

Attempting to bypass automod will result in you getting punished for the rule you broke **and we will be stricter than usual**.

## 10. Don’t Find Loopholes in the Rules

No rules list is completely cohesive. If you feel like you’ve been treated unfairly by a moderator, please report it to an admin.

If you feel like you’ve been treated unfairly by an admin, DM No Text To Speech.

**_If you intentionally are finding loopholes or misreporting abuse to staff, you will be punished accordingly._**

</Callout>
